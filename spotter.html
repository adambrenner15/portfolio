			<h2 class="center">Overview</h2>
            <p class="spotter_overview">Following my competitive soccer career, I knew I needed to find a way to remain active.  In college, I have been a casual gym user.  However I did not have enough motivation or experience in the gym to feel comfortable going consistently. Recently, I began working out with one of my friends and immediately felt more motivated and accountable to go to the gym on a regular basis. Spotter is an app that connects active and casual gym users to one another. 
			</p>
			<p class="spotter_overview"><br>Nowadays, everyone has digital technology at their fingertips. I wanted to create a platform that takes aspects of people's favorite social media apps and construct it in a way that is designated to connecting gym users to interact with each other. Spotter functions as a way for people to link up and work out together, as well as post healthy food recipes and motivational workout content. My goal is to make working out more than just an activity and rather a way for people to create social streams and connections.</p>
        </div>
		<h2 class="center">First,</h2>
		<p class="center">I created two personas in order to represent my target audience: all gym users - active or not.</p>
		<div class="grid_container">
			<img class='spotter_images_chris' src="imgs/spotterchris.jpg" alt="spotter chris"/>
			<img class='spotter_images_mic' src="imgs/spottermic.jpg" alt="spotter mic"/>
		</div>
		<h2 class="center">Then,</h2>
		<p class="center">I recorded my initial ideas and thoughts in order to figure out how to best approach my goal.</p>
		<div class="grid_container">
			<img class='spotter_images_chris' src="imgs/inthought1.png" alt="spotter thought"/>
			<img class='spotter_images_mic' src="imgs/inthought2.png" alt="spotter thought"/>
		</div>
		<h2 class="center">Next,</h2>
		<p class="center">I created a Google Form to gain insight into whether or not my idea would be viable for people to use. <br> From the information provided by the Google Form results, I was able to follow through with my idea.</p>
		<div class="grid_container">
			<img class='spotter_images_chris' src="imgs/wirefram1.png" alt="spotter wirerfame"/>
			<img class='spotter_images_mic' src="imgs/wireframe2.png" alt="spotter wireframe2"/>
		</div>
		<p class="center">I began making wireframes for my application. I took my original wireframe and added more specifications. <br> I interviewed potential users to create a user story and user journey to highlight improvements and stress points that were in my original wireframes.
			After gathering all of the feedback from the interviews, I transferred my wireframes to Adobe XD to finalize the design of the app. I took elements from iOS and Google templates in order to design the look and feel of the Spotter app.
