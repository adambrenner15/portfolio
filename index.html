				<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Adam.</h2>
				<p>
					Iâ€™m a Michigan-based Data Analyst currently studying @ The University of Michigan â€“ School of Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am currently a Juniour majoring in Information Analysis and minoring in Business Administration.
					If you were to ask me what I was going study when I first started at U of M, I would have told you Finance or Economics.
					I've always been drawn to finding solutions to problems with an analytical mindset. While my focus shifted, I still strive to 
					find answers that are meaningful to people through data and technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming from an iSchool, I have developed both hard and soft skills, from coding, statistics, information and 
					data analysis to communication, collaboration and creative problem solving.
					The School of Information has provided me with the skills and knowledge to identify and ask questions that matter 
					to stakeholders, gather essential data to answer questions, find answers that are grounded in empirical evidence with a strong attention to detail, and present the answers in a convincing and relevant way.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am passionate about Data Analysis and User Experience Design with a focus on the intersection between 
                    people and technology and how they interact. Outside of my studies, I enjoy listing to music, 
					traveling the world, and meeting new people.
